# Trianglify Background Generator

![](app.png)

A tool to generate images from SVGs rendered by the [Trianglify](https://github.com/qrohlf/trianglify) JS plugin.

The app utilises the [ColourLovers](http:colourlovers.com) API to allow backgrounds to be generated using colours from the top 100
palettes.

## Issues

There are some compatibility issues regarding conversion of SVGs to images in-browser. At the moment
the Download feature does not work in Safari.
